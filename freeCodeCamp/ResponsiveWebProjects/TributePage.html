        <p>Teaching was always my dream. Well, once I realized that enjoying a good argument isn't enought of a reason to become a lawyer. 
            I've been teaching since 2003 and never saw myself retiring. COVID has changed that.</p>
        <p>After working with prepackaged, asyncronous curriculum for K-2, I realized that I want the ability to build it myself.
            I see a need for digital K-2 curriclum built by someone with more of an education background than a developer background.
            I'm capable of learning to code and design in an electronic environment, so here I am.</p>
        <p>I don't want to completely leave education, but I do want to move into curriclum design and development.</p>
         <p><strong>Education Week</strong> has an article on <a id="tribute-link" target=_blank href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/did-covid-19-really-drive-teachers-to-quit/2020/11">how COVID-19 is not necessarily causing teachers to quit.</a>
        If you read carefully, many teachers feel as though their options are limited. Picking up some new skills can change that.</p>
